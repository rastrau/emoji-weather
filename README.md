## Data sources
[@tweteoswiss](https://twitter.com/tweteoswiss) uses data from [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org). 

The map design is hand-crafted by me. It can be called a tile map, grid(ded) map, or cartogram. I like tile maps, you can see other examples I've made [here](https://github.com/ebp-group/Switzerland_Tilemap), [here](https://rastrau.shinyapps.io/covid-us), [here](https://rastrau.shinyapps.io/covid-eu), or [here](https://rastrau.shinyapps.io/covidmonitor/) (the latter three I've contributed to the [{geofacet}](https://hafen.github.io/geofacet/) package for R).

## Usage conditions and contributions
